<b><font face=arial size=2>Washington, D.C.<br>
March 4, 1865</b><p>

This theologically intense speech has been widely acknowledged 
as one of the most remarkable documents in American history. The 
<I>London Spectator</I> said of it, "We cannot read it without a 
renewed conviction that it is the noblest political document known 
to history, and should have for the nation and the statesmen he 
left behind him something of a sacred and almost prophetic character."<P>

Journalist Noah Brooks, who witnessed the speech, said that 
as Lincoln advanced from his seat, "a roar of applause shook the 
air, and, again and again repeated, finally died away on the outer 
fringe of the throng, like a sweeping wave upon the shore. Just at 
that moment the sun, which had been obscured all day, burst forth 
in its unclouded meridian splendor, and flooded the spectacle with 
glory and with light." Brooks said Lincoln told him the next day, "Did you 
notice that sunburst? It made my heart jump."<P>

According to Brooks, the audience received the speech in "profound silence," 
although some passages provoked cheers and applause. "Looking down 
into the faces of the people, illuminated by the bright rays of 
the sun, one could see moist eyes and even tearful faces."

Brooks also observed, "But chiefly memorable in the mind 
of those who saw that second inauguration must still remain the tall, 
pathetic, melancholy figure of the man who, then inducted into office 
in the midst of the glad acclaim of thousands of people, and illumined 
by the deceptive brilliance of a March sunburst, was already standing 
in the shadow of death." He was referring, of course, to Lincoln's 
sudden death by assassination only weeks after the speech.<P>

<B>At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, 
there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the 
first. Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be 
pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four 
years, during which public declarations have been constantly called 
forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still 
absorbs the attention, and engrosses the energies of the nation, 
little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, 
upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public 
as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and 
encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction 
in regard to it is ventured.<P>

On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts 
were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded 
it--all sought to avert it. While the inaugeral [sic] address was 
being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to <I>saving</I> 
the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking 
to <I>destroy</I> it without war--seeking to dissole [sic] the 
Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated 
war; but one of them would <I>make</I> war rather than let the 
nation survive; and the other would <I>accept</I> war rather than 
let it perish. And the war came.<P>

One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not 
distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern 
part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. 
All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war. To 
strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for 
which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the 
government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the 
territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war, 
the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained. 
Neither anticipated that the <I>cause</I> of the conflict might 
cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. Each 
looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and 
astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; 
and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange 
that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge 
not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be 
answered; that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has 
his own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offences! for it 
must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the 
offence cometh!" If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one 
of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, 
but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills 
to remove, and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible 
war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we 
discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which 
the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we 
hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may 
speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all 
the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of 
unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood 
drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the 
sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be 
said "the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether"<P>

With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the 
right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish 
the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for 
him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his 
orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting 
peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.</b><P>
